â€¢ Understanding how to create and access elements in a list

in Python a list is a collection of items and you can create one using square brackets [] and
separate elements by commas. You can access elements in a list by referring to their index.

lang = ['python', 'java', 'php', '.net']

# Accessing elements  index
print(lang[0])  # First element: 'python'
