• Dictionary methods like keys(), values(), and items().

Ans:
dictionaries are a powerful data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. There are several built-in methods for interacting with dictionaries, including keys(), values(), and items(). 

1. keys()
Purpose: This method returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
        Syntax: dict.keys()
        Return: A view object that reflects the dictionary's keys. This view object behaves like a set.

2. values()
Purpose: This method returns a view object that displays all the values in the dictionary.
        Syntax: dict.values()
        Return: A view object that reflects the dictionary's values.

3. items()
Purpose: This method returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary’s key-value tuple pairs.
        Syntax: dict.items()
        Return: A view object that reflects the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples.
