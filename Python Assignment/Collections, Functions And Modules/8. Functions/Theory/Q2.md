â€¢ Different types of functions: with/without parameters, with/without return values. 
Ans:
there are 2 types of functions 

      1) built-in function :
            which is predefined by python 
            e.g. print(), len(), count(), input()

            note that list.append(), list.extend() are called methods
            diffrence between method and function is that method is always used after something and it is
            dependent, function is always independent and called without any other thing.
      2) user-defined function
            which is created by user for there own purpose.

Function categories 
1) function without parameter and return type.
            e.g. def myfun()
                  pass

2) function with parameter and without return type.
            e.g. def myfun(parameter)
                  pass
                  
3) function without parameter and with return type.
            e.g. def myfun()
                  return value

4) function with parameter and return type.
            e.g. def myfun(parameter)
                  return value
