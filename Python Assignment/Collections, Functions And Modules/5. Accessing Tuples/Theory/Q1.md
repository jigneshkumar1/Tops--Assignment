• Accessing tuple elements using positive and negative indexing. 


Ans: 

In Python, tuples are ordered collections of elements, and you can access their elements using both positive and negative indexing. Here’s a quick explanation:

        1) Positive Indexing
           Positive indexing starts from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second element.

        2) Negative Indexing
           Negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element, -2 for the second-to-last element
