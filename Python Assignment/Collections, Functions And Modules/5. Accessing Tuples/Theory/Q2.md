â€¢ Slicing a tuple to access ranges of elements. 

Ans:

In Python, you can slice a tuple to access a range of elements using the slicing 
syntax: tuple[start:end:step]. The start index is where the slice begins, end is where the slice ends 
(but it doesn't include the element at that index), and step allows you to specify how much to skip between elements.
