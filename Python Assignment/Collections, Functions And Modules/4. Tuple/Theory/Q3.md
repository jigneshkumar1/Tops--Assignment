â€¢ Basic operations with tuples: concatenation, repetition, membership. 

Ans: 
    Tuples are immutable sequences, and you can perform several basic operations on them, such as concatenation, repetition, and membership tests.
    
    1) Concatenation:
       Concatenation combines two or more tuples into a single tuple. You use the + operator for concatenation.

    2) Repetition
       Repetition repeats a tuple a specified number of times. You use the * operator for repetition.

    3) Membership
       Membership checks whether an element is present in a tuple. You use the in operator for membership   testing.
