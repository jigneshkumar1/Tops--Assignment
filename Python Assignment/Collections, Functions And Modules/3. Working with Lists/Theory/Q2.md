â€¢ Sorting and reversing a list using sort(), sorted(), and reverse().

Ans: 
1. using sort(): 
                The sort() method sorts the list in place, meaning the original list is modified, and no new list is returned.
                By default, it sorts in ascending order.
                You can also pass additional arguments to change the sorting behavior 
                
2. Using sorted():
                The sorted() function returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.
                Like sort(), it also accepts reverse=True and key for custom sorting.

3. using reverse():
                The reverse() method reverses the list in place, meaning it does not sort the list, just reverses its order.
                It modifies the original list.
