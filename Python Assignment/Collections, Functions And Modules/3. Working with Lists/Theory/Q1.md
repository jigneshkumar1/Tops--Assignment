â€¢ Iterating over a list using loops. 

Ans:
    
    Iteration is the process of looping through elements in a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. When you need to process each item in a list, you can use loops. The most common types of loops used for iteration in Python are the for loop and the while loop.
