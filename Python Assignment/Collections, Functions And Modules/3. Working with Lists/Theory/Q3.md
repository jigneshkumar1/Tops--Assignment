â€¢ Basic list manipulations: addition, deletion, updating, and slicing.

Ans: 

1. Addition: 
        To add elements to a list, you can use the following methods:

        1) append(): Adds a single element to the end of the list.
        2) insert(): Adds an element at a specific index.
        3) extend(): Adds multiple elements (from another iterable) to the end of the list.
        4) + operator: Concatenate lists.
            ex: my_list = [1,2,3,4]
                new_list = my_list + [5,6,7]
                print(new_list)

2. Deletion:
        To remove elements from a list, you can use these methods:

        1) remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value
        2) pop(): Removes and returns the element at the specified index (default is the last element)
        3) del statement: Deletes an element at a specific index or deletes the entire list

3. Updating:
        To update the value of an element in a list, simply assign a new value to the desired index.

        ex: my_list = [1, 2, 3]
            my_list[1] = 5  # Updates element index 1
            print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3]

4. slicing:
        list slicing allows you to access a subset of a list.
        
        1) Basics slicing      
        2) Slicing with step
        3) Negative indices 
        4) Slicing with start or end:
