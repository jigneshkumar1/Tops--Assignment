â€¢ Common list operations: concatenation, repetition, membership. 

Ans : 

        In Python lists support several common operations that help manipulate and work with their data. Here are the basic operations for concatenation, repetition, and membership:

        1. Concatenation (+)
            Concatenation combines two or more lists into a single list. This is done using the + operator

        2. repetition (*)
            Repetition allows you to repeat a list a specific number of times using the * operator

        3. membership (in an not in)
            Membership checks whether an element exists in a list.  if an element exists, and not in for checking if an element does not exist
